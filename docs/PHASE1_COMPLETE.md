**Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Core S3 API

## Overview

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for the Zot Artifact Store project, including:
- Project structure and build system
- Extension framework architecture
- Testing infrastructure
- Deployment configurations
- Comprehensive documentation

## Completed Tasks (8/8)

### 1. ✅ Set up Go project structure
- Initialized Go module: `github.com/candlekeep/zot-artifact-store`
- Created directory structure following Go best practices
- Set up package organization: cmd, pkg, internal, test
- Configured .gitignore and .dockerignore

### 2. ✅ Add Zot latest stable as dependency
- Integrated Zot v1.4.3 as base registry
- Configured go.mod with required dependencies
- Added replace directives for dependency compatibility
- Verified integration with basic server startup

### 3. ✅ Create Containerfile with Red Hat UBI base images
- Multi-stage build using Red Hat UBI 9
- Builder stage: `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/go-toolset:latest`
- Runtime stage: `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest`

- Makefile targets: podman-build, podman-run

### 5. ✅ Design and implement Zot extension integration framework
- Extension interface with lifecycle methods
- Extension registry for managing extensions
- Four core extensions implemented as stubs:
  - **S3 API Extension**: S3-compatible API (Phase 2)
  - **RBAC Extension**: Keycloak integration (Phase 3)
  - **Supply Chain Extension**: Signing, SBOM, attestations (Phase 4)
  - **Metrics Extension**: Enhanced Prometheus metrics (Phase 6)
- Graceful setup and shutdown
- Extension configuration structure

### 6. ✅ Set up testing infrastructure
- Test helper utilities (test/testing.go)
- Mock implementations for storage
- Given-When-Then test pattern examples
- Unit test coverage: 27.3% (foundation code)
- Integration and E2E test structure (READMEs)
- TDD-focused development approach

### 7. ✅ Create ZotArtifactStore CRD definition
- Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition
- API version: v1alpha1
- Comprehensive spec including:
  - Image configuration
  - Replica management
  - HTTP and TLS settings
  - Storage backends (filesystem, S3, Azure, GCP)
  - Extension configuration
  - Resource limits
  - Logging settings
- Status tracking
- Sample CR configurations (minimal and full)

### 8. ✅ Write initial project documentation
- README.md with overview and quick start
- CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- GETTING_STARTED.md with installation instructions
- CHANGELOG.md for tracking changes
- Operator deployment guide
- Test documentation (integration, e2e)

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns with extension pattern
- Modular design for independent feature development
- Zot integration without core modifications
- OpenShift-native deployment support

### Code Quality
- TDD approach established
- Test coverage infrastructure in place
- CI/CD ready structure
- Linting and formatting configured

### Build System
- Multi-stage container builds
- Static binary compilation
- Cross-platform support (CGO disabled)
- Development automation with Make

### Deployment
- Container-based deployment ready
- Kubernetes CRD defined
- OpenShift compatibility verified
- Multiple deployment modes supported

## Metrics

- **Go Files**: 9 source files
- **Test Files**: 2 files
- **Lines of Code**: ~1,200 (excluding tests and generated files)
- **Test Coverage**: 27.3% (foundation infrastructure)
- **Extensions**: 4 registered and initialized
- **Dependencies**: Zot v1.4.3 + transitive dependencies
- **Container Stages**: 2 (multi-stage build)
- **CRD Fields**: 50+ configurable parameters

## Build & Test Results

```bash
✅ make build - Success
✅ make test - All tests passing
✅ make podman-build - Container builds successfully
✅ Extension registration - 4/4 extensions loaded
✅ Server startup - Successfully initializes (requires storage config)
```

## Known Limitations (Expected)

1. **Storage**: Server requires valid storage configuration to fully start
2. **Extensions**: All extensions are stubs (implementation in later phases)
3. **Operator**: CRD defined but operator not implemented (Phase 12)
4. **API**: No S3 endpoints yet (Phase 2)
5. **RBAC**: No authentication/authorization yet (Phase 3)
6. **Supply Chain**: No signing/SBOM features yet (Phase 4)

## Next Phase: Phase 2 - Core S3 API

### Objectives
1. Implement S3-compatible REST API
2. Add resumable upload support (HTTP 206)
3. Create bucket management operations
4. Implement artifact metadata storage
5. Add multipart upload support
6. Test with S3 client tools

### Tasks (~40 tasks)
- REST endpoint implementation
- Request/response handling
- Artifact metadata management
- Resumable upload logic
- Bucket operations
- Integration tests
- S3 compatibility testing

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Clean project structure established
✅ Zot integration working
✅ Extension framework operational
✅ Tests passing with TDD infrastructure
✅ Container deployment working
✅ CRD defined and validated
✅ Documentation comprehensive
✅ Ready for Phase 2 development

## Recommendations for Phase 2

1. **Start with REST API structure**: Define route handlers and middleware
2. **Implement bucket operations first**: Foundation for artifact storage
3. **Add metadata storage**: BoltDB integration for artifact metadata
4. **Incremental testing**: TDD for each endpoint
5. **S3 compatibility testing**: Use aws-cli and boto3 for validation
6. **Documentation**: Update OpenAPI specs as endpoints are added

## Conclusion

Phase 1 successfully establishes a solid foundation for the Zot Artifact Store project. The extension framework provides clean separation of concerns, the testing infrastructure supports TDD, and the deployment configurations enable both development and production use cases.

The project is well-positioned to proceed with Phase 2 implementation of the core S3-compatible API.
